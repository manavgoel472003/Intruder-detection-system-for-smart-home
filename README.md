# Intruder Detection System for Smart Home

This project focuses on using OpenCV to obtain a continuous cam video from your device, and then processes it to detect intruder.
If the intruder is detected the intuder's captured photo is sent to the authorised person's mail. 

## Face recognition working
- An authorised person's picture is taken, which is then converted into the face-encoding of that person
- This encoding will be matched up with face-encodings of the frames that are being captured
- Based on the results the system will act as specified
